# I Saw a Playhouse, My Daughter Saw a Jail

**我之乐园 彼之牢笼 / 当代情感**

MY year-old grandson, Leo, wraps his arm around my neck as we leave the diner in Barre, Vt., where his mother, Anna, and my wife are having breakfast. Because Leo will not stop throwing utensils across the table, I offer to take him to a nearby hardware store to explore an environment where he cannot wreak as much havoc.

我的小外孙 Leo 用他的手环住我的脖子，我们一起离开 Barre, Vt. 的一个餐厅，他的妈妈 Anna 和我妻子正在那里吃早饭。因为 Leo 在饭桌上不停的将餐具扔来扔去，所以我提议由我带他到附近的一个五金商店逛一逛，这样她们就可以好好吃饭了。

After a protracted and chaotic adolescence, our younger daughter, Anna, has just begun her final year of college. This boy with flax-blond hair and light blue eyes is her gift to the family she has been trying to flee for the last decade. Toy cars, real trains and mechanical objects of all sizes fascinate Leo. He and I spend our time together exploring lumberyards, railroad depots and any highway department that possesses a road grader, an excavator or a dump truck.

经过一个长而混乱的青春期，我们的小女儿 Anna 终于回归了，开始了她大学的最后一年。这些年她一直逃避着我们，Leo 这个有着一头亚麻金色头发和淡蓝色眼睛的男孩是她给我们带回的礼物。Leo 喜欢玩具小汽车，喜欢真正的火车，各种大大小小的机械装置吸引着他。他喜欢和我一起探索伐木场，探索火车站，探索高速上那些有着压土机、挖掘机和自动倾卸卡车的地方。

As we enter the hardware store, the middle-aged woman working the cash register says: “Oh, my Lord. Can I hold that baby?” After Leo completes his first romantic conquest, we move toward merchandise he cannot destroy: metal fasteners, plastic pipes and rope. But when I am distracted for a moment, he takes a large two-socket switch from a waist-high bin.

我们一进入五金商店，收银柜台后面的那个中年妇女就叫起来 “哇，好可爱啊，我能抱抱他吗？” 她们一番亲热之后，我带着 Leo 往那些没办法乱折腾的商品区走去：什么金属紧固件啊、塑料管、塑料绳啊之类的。我稍微一会没注意，他从一个齐腰的桶里拿起一个两眼插座。

“Hey buddy,” I whisper, returning the socket to the shelf, “This stuff is dangerous.” I point to the plugs, junction boxes and fluorescent lights, saying, “This is hot.”

“宝贝，这东西可有点危险” 我边对他说，边将插座放回架子上。我又指了指插头，接线盒和日光灯对他说到：“这些东西烫（电）人”。

He lays his head against my shoulder and smiles sweetly. I don’t want to make my grandson fearful, but I feel the need to protect him.

他头靠在我的肩膀上甜甜的笑着，我并不想吓坏我的外孙，但我觉得我需要保护他。

When we reach wood products, I let him examine things more freely. “I built your mommy a playhouse one summer,” I say. That summer, in my attempt to turn our suburban quarter-acre lot into child’s paradise, I learned how to dig posts, pour cement, hang floor joists, work with oil-based paints and frame walls.

当我们来到木工用具区的时候，我让他仔细的把玩这些东西。“我曾经给你妈妈建过一个玩具小屋”，我说。那个夏天，我尝试将我们我们郊外的那一小块地方变成儿童的乐园，我学会了如何挖柱洞，学会了如何倒水泥，学会了如何挂楼板梁，如何搭墙漆墙。

But during the months I worked on it, Anna, who was nearing 10, began to turn her back on childhood. By the time I completed the playhouse at summer’s end, she wouldn’t have been caught dead in it.

但在我忙着这些的时候， Anna 已经快 10 岁了，她的童年也即将结束，在夏天结束我完成这个玩具小屋的时候，她怎么也不愿进去玩。

A year earlier, we had gone to London for six months. Anna, who didn’t understand why she could not have as much freedom as her 16-year-old sister, had demanded the right to explore our neighborhood by herself and to wander through Hampstead Heath, a wilderness that is almost the size of Central Park, with the new (and more liberated) friends she had made there.

一年前，我们去伦敦玩了 6 个月， Anna 一直不明白为什么她没法子像她 16 岁的姐姐一样自由的玩耍，她要求可以和她的新小伙伴们在我们住的周边还有汉普特斯西斯公园玩耍的权利，天呐，那个公园有纽约的中央公园那么大，基本就是荒地。

When we returned home to upstate New York, Anna, now in fourth grade, began producing prize-winning short stories and science projects. We felt lucky to have such an accomplished — if rather mutinous — daughter.

我们回到纽约后， Anna 四年级了，她开始写一些短篇故事（还获了奖），搞一些科学小项目，我们都为有这么一个能力超群只是 —— 有点反叛 —— 的女儿而自豪。

The first signs of genuine teenage rebellion appeared when she was 11, on a weeklong raft trip in Idaho. Egged on by a 16-year-old girl from the suburbs of Los Angeles, Anna began shadowing the teenagers who spent their evenings smoking exotic hand-rolled cigarettes among the ponderosa pines that surrounded our campsites.

第一次真正的青春期反叛发生在她 11 岁的时候，在我们一次爱达河上为时一周的皮筏旅行途中，在一个洛杉矶郊区 16 岁的小姑娘怂恿下，Anna 开始跟着一些不良小青年，他们夜里在我们扎营的地方周围的小树林里抽一些手工卷的烟。

Later that year my wife and I took a six-month academic sabbatical in Berkeley, Calif., and pulled Anna from school to do so. When we returned, the dynamic of her former friendships had changed and she found herself excluded, whereupon she quickly fell in with a crowd of outcasts on the lookout for new recruits.

那年下半年我和妻子在加州伯克利休了 6 个月的假，我们让 Anna 休学和我们一起去。当她回来时，她发现自己被排除在以前的朋友圈外，很快她就和一些无所事事的不良混在一起。

Soon teenagers wearing purple eye shadow, spiked dog collars and black leather could be found in our house at all hours. Anna began ignoring curfews, refusing to tell us where she was going, and coming home in strange cars.

很快我家就经常出现一些戴着紫色眼影，套着上面布满亮晶晶钉子的狗脖套还有穿着黑皮衣的不良青年，Anna 开始无视宵禁，拒绝告诉我们她去哪，搭奇奇怪怪的车回家。

I had spent years as a whitewater guide in the Adirondacks, and Anna had loved being there with me, even serving as my assistant several times. Thinking a return to that life might be the cure for her rebelliousness, I took her to the Adirondacks for a rafting trip. But every time I gave her instructions, an interaction that in the past had demonstrated our closeness, I now got a sullen stare, the kind that said that I did not understand or respect her.

我在阿迪朗达克山脉中当过好几年的漂流向导，Anna 喜欢和我一起在那里，她还有几次当过我的助手。想着可以拉近我们的关系平息一点她的反叛，我又带她去了一次阿迪朗达克山脉漂流，但这次，我一给她一些指令，她就冷冷的看着我，就是那种觉得我一点都不理解她不尊重她，那种眼神，但以前这种互动会让我们彼此之间更亲密。

How does this happen? How does a child who spends her early life glued to your hip suddenly turn into a person who seems convinced that you were put on earth simply to frustrate her ambitions and dreams?

这一切都是怎么发生的，以前那个喜欢黏在我的屁股后面转的小姑娘怎么就变成现在这个 *认为我存在在这个世界上的意义就是为了打击她的抱负和梦想* 的人了。

Of course, I understood her feelings. My own father and I had had a distant relationship in which much of what I received from him was withering criticism. Unable to appreciate my father’s frustrations and limitations, which included periodic unemployment and debilitating illnesses, I had spent my own teenage years retreating from his dissatisfaction and rage.

当然，我明白她的感受，我和我的父亲的关系就很冷淡，我从我父亲那得到的永远是批评，批评还是批评。我无法理解我父亲的绝望和局限（时不时的事业和疾病），我整个青少年时期都在逃避他的不满和愤怒。

But I was going to be a different kind of father, one who would use reason, not rage. Even so, I didn’t fully see that my hopes for Anna would not automatically become her hopes. I didn’t understand how futile and naïve was my goal of a trouble-free adolescence for my younger daughter.

我要和我的父亲不一样，我要和我的孩子理性沟通，而不是使用暴力沟通，但是我没搞明白的是，我的想法并不是 Anna 的想法，我希望她有一个无忧无虑没有各种麻烦的青春，当是时，我并不知道这个目标有多么的徒劳和幼稚。

When Anna met a boy who confirmed her suspicion that suburbia was pure hell and her parents little more than well-mannered jailers, our troubles escalated.

终于有一天 Anna 遇到了一个男孩，一个和她一样认为 * 我们居住的郊区地方就是纯粹的地狱，她的父母只不过是两个比较礼貌的牢房看守 * 的男孩。我们的麻烦开始升级。

He was a brilliant student and talented cellist, but he had dropped out of high school, left his family and lived in abandoned apartments, doorways and, eventually, a cardboard box in the woods. Tall, gaunt, silent, poetic and spellbindingly intense, he soon welcomed our daughter as part of his posse. They roamed the city together, two lost souls in search of romance and trouble.

这个男孩曾经是一个优秀的学生，一个有天赋的大提琴手，但是他高中退学了，离开了家，住在各种荒废的房子或者门廊中，最后住在树林里的一个纸箱里。他高大，苍白，安静，诗意，热情，他很快就欢迎我女儿和他成为一伙，他们在城市的大街上漫步，两个迷失的心寻找着浪漫和麻烦。

ATTEMPTING to rescue her, we sent Anna to a wilderness camp in Wyoming with the hope that she would embrace the values we thought we had failed to instill in her. When she returned a month later, bronzed, thin and marathon-fit, she set up a tarp in our yard. “I can’t live in the house anymore,” she said. “Not after being in the mountains.”

为了挽救她，我们将 Annna 送到了怀俄明的一个野营地，希望她在里面的经历能够让她接受那些我们觉得正面但是我们自己没有传承给她的价值观。一个月后她回来了，古铜色，瘦了，像个马拉松选手，她在院子里搭了一个小帐篷，“在大山里住了这么久之后，我已经无法在屋子里面生活了” 她说。

Anna slept outside for seven weeks, from Labor Day until late October, when persistent rain finally drove her indoors. During those weeks, I would go to our back door every night around 11 and stare at her sleeping form in the darkness, 20 yards from the house. Somewhere out there, less than a half-mile away, was another child, this one living in a cardboard box. He and I were locked in a terrible struggle, one that I knew he would win.

Anna 在外面睡了 7 个星期，从劳动节一直睡到国庆节，直到连绵的秋雨才最终将她赶回了屋里。这段时间里，每天夜里 11 点左右我都会走到我家的后门，看着她在黑暗中睡着的模样，半公里之外的某一个地方睡着另一个孩子，那个睡在纸箱里的青年，我和他已经这样斗争了很久，而且我知道他最终会赢。

He had everything going for him: limitless energy, a willing accomplice and a pure, uncomplicated contempt for everything I believed in — my fierce attachment to family, in particular. I was the embodiment of everything he despised, the guardian of obsolete behaviors and values, a dimwitted, overprotective and confused dinosaur who could not grasp the significance of reggae, rap, tattoos, tongue studs and ripped clothing. It would be no contest.

一切都向着他，他有无限的精力，他有一个只要一句话就心甘情愿跟他走的共犯，他鄙视我所珍视的一切 —— 尤其是我对家庭强烈的感情。我是他所鄙视的一切的化身，是过时的传统的卫道者，一个愚蠢的过分保护女儿的老朽，永远也搞不明白雷鬼、饶舌、纹身、舌钉、破洞衣这些是何等的重要。我根本不是他的对手。

Anna, now 16, began staying away from home for days on end. Just as a thick fog began to blanket our neighborhood one Friday evening, she came back one last time.

Anna，现在 16 岁，终于开始宿夜不归。终于在一个大雾的星期五傍晚，她最后一次回来。

I met her on the front stoop. She was leaving for good, she said, and simply wanted to be able to retrieve her clothes. I said then exactly what you should not say in such circumstances: “You’re not going anywhere until you come inside and talk to us about it.” The scene became increasingly surreal as her friends at the car began chanting, “Let Anna go! Let Anna go!”

我在门口遇见她，“我要走了”，她说，“我只是回来拿下我的衣服”。然后我说了下面这句你们在这种场景下千万别说的话，我说 “你哪也去不了，你给我进来，给我说清楚”。她的朋友在周围起哄 “让她走，让她走”。整个场景开始变得越来越不像现实。

I continued to insist that she come in and talk, but she screamed, “You can’t deny me my clothes!” before finally fleeing to the car and speeding off. Six weeks later, school administrators, citing her record of truancy and disobedience, expelled her.

我继续坚持要她进来，我们谈谈，她开始尖叫，“你不能不让我拿衣服”，最后她坐上车加速离开了。6 个星期后，因为旷课和不听话，她被学校退学。

Anna would take to the road for two years, traveling with her boyfriend out West and elsewhere, working odd jobs to survive. Then she would attend college for two years before dashing off again, this time with a new boyfriend, commencing what would be another two-year stint on the road.

Anna 还将继续在路上 2 年，和她男朋友一起去西部以及其它地方旅行，靠打零工维持生活。然后她进了大学，然后两年后又一次逃学，这次是和一个新男朋友，开始另一次 2 年的在路上。

Though she had physically rejected us, she didn’t let go — far from it. Throughout these years, she called us every few days to keep us abreast of her activities. I suspect she needed to know we cared about her. For us the calls were worrisome, painful, but better than nothing, I suppose.

虽然这些年她没再见我们，她并没有忘记我们，相反，这些年，她每隔几天就会给我们一个电话告诉我们她在做什么。我怀疑她想确认我们还在乎她。这些电话让我们焦急，痛苦，但是总比什么也没有好吧，大概。

It took some time for us to see the situation as it really had been. I didn’t know what was at the root of Anna’s rebellion, and perhaps I’ll never know. But I do recognize that we failed in how we were only able to see the part of her that was reacting to us, not the child who was growing up much too quickly and was still terribly afraid.

很久以后我才明白这些，我不知道 Anna 反叛的根源是什么，也许永远也不会知道了。但我知道：我们以前只看到了她反抗我们的一面，我们没能看到她另外的那一面，一个迅速成长中但也害怕恐惧的孩子。

I COULD not admit until much later that no matter how understanding I claimed to be, I had behaved as though Anna were my surrogate, her behavior a reflection of my parenting skills, her beliefs a mirror of my ideals, her goals a product of my ambition.

很久以后我才不得不承认，虽然我自诩自己很理性，但我其实我将 Anna 当成了自己的替身，她的行为对应了我的育儿技术，她的信念对应了我的理想，她的目标对应了我的理想。

I may have said that I wished to set her free, but it was always my agenda that I hoped she would follow, my efforts as a father she would eventually acknowledge and admire. I had avoided repeating the mistakes of my father, but I had made different ones. When Anna finally settled down in northeast Vermont, she found a person to share her life with and a reason to begin her own family.

我嘴上说要放她自由，但我总是希望她照着我设计的路来走，我希望她能看到并欣赏我为她做的一切，我想避免那些我父亲曾经犯过的错却无形中犯下了其它各种个样的错。Anna 最后在佛蒙特州东北安定了下来，她找到了共度人生的人开始了自己的家庭。

And as grandchildren often do, Leo has shaken up our dynamic and given us all an excuse to see one another more often and in situations of real love and appreciation. He doesn’t know the gift he brings, but the rest of us are well aware.

外孙 Leo 成为了我们之间的一个纽带，我们可以借口他更多的见到彼此，共享天伦之乐。他是上帝给我们的礼物。

As Leo and I explored the hardware store that morning, I pointed out the equipment that he would need to help his parents build their new home. “It will be just like that playhouse I built for your Mommy,” I told him. “But much better.”

当我和 Leo 今天早上一起逛着五金商店的时候，我指着一套可以用来帮他父母建造他的玩具小屋的工具说 “小屋会非常像我以前给你妈妈建的那个玩具小屋，但是…… 会更好 “。

Our chore finished, a bag of tools in hand, Leo and I march back to the now-crowded diner.

我们的惯例活动结束了，我和 Leo 拿着一包工具走进了现在开始热闹起来的餐厅。

Anna smiles at us. “You roughnecks have fun?”

Anna 笑着对我们说：” 你们两个大粗人玩得还好吗？“

As Leo leaps into her arms, I place beside her the tools I bought to help her and her family build their new cabin in the woods.

Leo 跳进她的怀抱，我把买来用来帮她们在小树林里建房的工具放在她旁边。
